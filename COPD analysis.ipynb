    "The process began by importing the pandas library in Python to read the provided Excel file containing data on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) death rates for the United States and Uganda in 2019. The index was converted to strings to align with the format of age groups. Dictionaries were initialized to store age-specific death rates for each country. A loop was implemented to iterate through each row of the DataFrame, extracting age group and corresponding death rates for both countries, and populating the dictionaries accordingly. It was assumed that the data in the Excel file was accurate and with no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences in calculated death rates between the United States and Uganda are influenced by various factors including disparities in healthcare systems, socio-economic conditions, lifestyle factors, and population demographics. These disparities can lead to variations in disease prevalence, access to healthcare, and overall mortality rates between the two countries, resulting in distinct crude and age-standardized death rates despite using the same standard population for age-standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The age-standardized death rates provide a comparative measure of mortality between the two countries, adjusting for differences in age distributions. The higher age-standardized death rate in the United States (75549.426 per 1000 population) compared to Uganda (71845.838 per 1000 population) suggests a higher burden of COPD-related mortality in the United States, even after accounting for differences in age structures. This underscores the need for targeted public health interventions in both countries to address COPD risk factors, improve access to healthcare, and reduce mortality rates."
